=== CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT ===

ESS Analysis:
--------------------
Minimum ESS: 1.00
Mean ESS: 24.84
Maximum ESS: 34.40

Convergence Criteria:
-------------------------
❌ Minimum ESS < 10: VERY POOR convergence

ESS Coefficient of Variation: 0.516
⚠️  Moderate ESS variability: Some diagnostics mix better than others

Recommendations:
---------------
- Consider increasing sampling steps or reducing thinning interval
- Check if step size is appropriate for the target distribution
- Verify that burn-in was sufficient
- High ESS variability suggests some diagnostics are more correlated than others
- Consider using different diagnostic scalars or increasing sample size
