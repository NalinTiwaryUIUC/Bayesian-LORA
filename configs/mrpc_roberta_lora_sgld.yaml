model:
  backbone: "roberta-base"
  max_sequence_length: 256
  lora:
    inject_into: ["query", "key", "value", "attention.output.dense"]  # Only attention modules
    rank: 8  # Increased for better expressiveness
    alpha: 16  # Increased proportionally with rank
    dropout: 0.1

data:
  dataset: "mrpc"
  batch_size: 32  # Optimized for best convergence and GPU utilization
  gradient_accumulation_steps: 1  # No longer needed with larger batch size
  max_epochs: 20

training:
  map_lora:
    optimizer: "sgd"  # Changed to SGD for apples-to-apples comparison with SGLD
    learning_rate: 1e-3  # Higher LR for SGD (typically needs 10x higher than AdamW)
    weight_decay: 0.01
    momentum: 0.9  # SGD momentum
    scheduler: "linear"
    warmup_ratio: 0.1
  
  sgld_lora:
    learning_rate: 5e-5  # Smaller step size for stable sampling
    temperature: 2.0  # Optimized for perfect noise-gradient balance
    prior_std: 9.5  # Optimal prior for balanced SGLD sampling (experimentally determined)
    step_size_schedule:
      initial: 5e-5  # Smaller step size for stable sampling
      decay_rate: 0.3  # Conservative decay for better convergence
      decay_steps: 3000  # Longer decay schedule
    gradient_clip_norm: 1.0
    noise_scale: 0.000015  # Optimized noise scale for temperature 2.0
    chains: 4  # Restored for R-hat computation
    burn_in_steps: 8000  # Sufficient burn-in for convergence
    sampling_steps: 12000  # More samples for better ESS
    thinning: 50  # Good thinning for sample independence
    samples_to_retain: 960  # Match total samples (4 chains * 240 samples per chain)
